# Network Connections Analysis Tool

A comprehensive Python-based tool for monitoring, diagnosing, and reporting on network performance across multiple interfaces with configurable thresholds, logging, historical tracking, and alerting capabilities.

## üöÄ Features

* Real-time interface monitoring and statistics
* Historical data tracking for up to 1000 entries per interface
* Threshold-based alerting (error rate, drop rate, bandwidth usage)
* Multi-interface and multi-protocol support
* Gateway and connection tracking
* Configurable logging, alert sensitivity, and threading
* Generate detailed JSON reports on demand or periodically

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The tool uses a configuration file (`network_manager.ini`) with the following default parameters:

```ini
[DEFAULT]
log_level = INFO
history_size = 1000
max_workers = 5
alert_thresholds = {
  "error_rate": 0.01,
  "drop_rate": 0.01,
  "bandwidth_usage": 0.8
}
```

Customize thresholds and behaviors as needed.

## üß™ Usage

```bash
python network_analysis.py [OPTIONS]
```

### Available Options:

| Option                    | Description                                             |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-c`, `--config`          | Path to configuration file (INI format)                 |
| `-r`, `--report`          | Generate a one-time network report                      |
| `-v`, `--verbose`         | Enable verbose (DEBUG) logging                          |
| `-m`, `--monitor SECONDS` | Continuously monitor network for the specified duration |

### Example: Run a live 60-second monitor with verbose output

```bash
python network_analysis.py -m 60 -v
```

### Example: Generate a single snapshot report

```bash
python network_analysis.py -r
```

## üìÑ Output

Reports are structured in JSON and include:

* **Timestamp**
* **Interface stats & addresses**
* **Active network connections**
* **Default gateway information**
* **Recent alerts**
* **History length per interface**
